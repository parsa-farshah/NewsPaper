            Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation
            where an app or website can be used for both work and personal
            situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13
            hours on the site, Codepen for work and her hobby, which
            unfortunately, is also coding.
            <br />
            <br />
            The designer, whose work includes a To-Do Terrarium, clarified,
            "Well, I didn't have to use it for work but it was already part of
            my workflow. It just made sense as it was
          </p>
          <p>
            more efficient." The biggest issue, she said, is that she would hop
            on Codepen for work, but would get distracted by pens made by others
            in the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then
            causes her to spend even more time on the site.
            <br />
            "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands
            itself as the best place to build, test, and discover front-end
            code, has declined to comment at this time.

                Making a floor Plan with CSS Grid? Talk about using the wrong
                tool for the job. But I guess this is what happens when someone
                isn't happy with any of the floor plans found on Pinterest;
                she'll start making her own
              </p>

                for the eventual home that she will never own. Nevertheless,
                there's a home office with a large window to look out of
                pensively during rainy days and a ton of "white space" for the
                cats to run around. 50% Off Hogwarts Express tickets

          <div>
            <p>
              Get your fill of more CSS Grid items in this collection. There are
              a total of 32 pens to date... well, 33, if you count this one too.
              What can you expect in this collection? The hidden gems, in my
              totally unbiased opinion, are the recreation of the Pac-Man layout
            </p>
            <p>
              and coupons inspired by junk mail. A lot of joke items of things
              that shouldn't be done in CSS Grid, such as a shelf? Bathroom
              tiles wtf? and makeup palettes . If you are a cultured person, you
              will have a chance to enjoy a couple of pens inspired by Harry
              Potter and
            </p>
            <p>
              Pokemon. On the rare occasion that you are looking at this profile
              for something you can use in production, you really shouldn't.
              But, there are some real-world applications, such as the recipe
              layout, the product catalog, and color palettes for a style guide.
